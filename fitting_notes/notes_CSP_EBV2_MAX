Numbers of SN using each fitting technique divided into categories
97 = total SN with Jband obs and in Burns 2018 sample

14 = SN with 5 or less J-band observations (not excluded simply noted)
SN2005ag = 4
SN2006ob = 2
SN2008bi = 4
SN2006ej = 5
SN2004gu = 3
SN2008O  = 5
SN2008cf = 1
SN2005na = 5
SN2008hu = 5
SN2005am = 4
SN2007jd = 3
SN2008fu = 3
SN2008bt = 1
SN2009le = 4

SN with first detection before +5 days
74/92 (80.4%) = max_model
75/91 (82.4%) = EBV_model2

SN with first detection before +10 days
82/92 (89.1%) = max_model
81/91 (89.0%) = EBV_model2




92 = SN on Hubble plot MAX MODEL s.fit(["B"]) --> s.fit(["J"],Tmax=s.Tmax)

5 = SN that could not be fit
SN2006ob Only 1 J-band datum
SN2008cf Only 1 J-band datum
SN2008fu Only 3 data points
SN2008bt only 1 Jband datum and unable to fit in B-band
SN2009al Only 1 J-band fit, fitting in only Jrc2 screws analysis

 = Remaining SN that could be fit but fit is visually poor
SN2006bd fitted in i-band instead of B-band
SN2006br fitted in g-band instead of B-band
maybe SN2008bi
SN2008hu Poor visual fitting
maybe SN2005ag
maybe SN2005na
maybe SN2007jd

5 = Remaining SN fitted with other filters and should be questioned
SN2005ke Fitted with r instead of B
SN2008bi Fitted with V instead of B
SN2007st Fitted with i instead of B
SN2006mr Fitted with V instead of B
SN2008cc Fitted with V instead of B




91 = SN on Hubble plot EBV_model2 s.fit(["B"]) --> s.fit(["J"],Tmax=s.Tmax)

6 = SN that could not be fit
SN2006ob Only 1 J-band datum
SN2008cf Only 1 J-band datum
SN2008fu Only 3 data points
SN2008bt only 1 Jband datum and unable to fit in B-band
SN2008bi Data too close together
SN2009al Only 1 J-band fit, fitting in only Jrc2 screws analysis

10 = Remaining SN that could be fit but fit is visually poor
SN2006bd fitted in i-band instead of B-band
SN2005A  fitted in i-band instead of B-band
SN2006br fitted in g-band instead of B-band
SN2009al Fitted using Jrc2 not J in 2nd fit but fit is questionable
SN2005hj Extremely large error from J-band observations very close together
SN2009F  Poor visual fitting
SN2008hu Poor visual fitting
SN2005ag Not enough data around peak
SN2005na Not enough data around peak
SN2007jd Not enough data around peak

4 = Remaining SN fitted with other filters and should be questioned
SN2007st Fitted with V instead of B
SN2006mr Fitted with V instead of B
SN2007bm Fitted with V instead of B
SN2008cc Fitted with V instead of B
